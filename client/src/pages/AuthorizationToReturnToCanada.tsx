              An Authorization to Return to Canada (ARC) is an official permission issued by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) allowing individuals who were previously removed, deported, or found inadmissible to legally return to Canada before the usual waiting period ends.

              Without an ARC, you cannot re-enter Canada legally during the period of inadmissibility. Obtaining an ARC ensures that your re-entry is authorized and avoids potential border refusal.
